# In this exercise my goal was to parse top 250 movies form IMDB web-site.
# What data I want to retreive - Movie title, Place (from 1 to 250), year of release and casting crew (Director, actors).
# To parse that kind of Data I used libraries - 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup4' for web scrapping, 
# 're' library for search of regular expressions to retreive 'year' data and 'pandas' library to later extract our data in more convinient format - CSV.
